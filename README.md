# HackNTU
simple opencv based project for HackNTU 2019
A simple software that has the power of 4
1) Face detection and Identification
2)Training of image data
3)Emotion classification
4) Audio classification and prediction

It provides as an interface and can be used as a security tool, an entertainment tool, an acting practice tool etc.
It is interfaced to firebase to indulge in the internet of things.

open login.py and username = Rahul, password = Password

train = trains data of images into yml files to predict faces
predict = predicts emotions and classifies face
take data = crops faces and creates a directory of face images
Audio = Can parse audio and get text of audio in most languages. Can also count the number of occurences of words

#We trained our own model but it was not accurate enough (as we could not train it long enough due to hackathon constraints) and we used a pretrained model and accompanying code to implement the model from a github repo that I do not remember the link of (we were very stressed and last minute). Though I will add it soon.
